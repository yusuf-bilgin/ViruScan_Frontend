# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# ViruScan_Frontend
This is the frontend of full-stack application I developed in 3-4 weeks using Spring Boot and React. In the backend, I execute a script file to access Windows Defender through PowerShell, scanning a requested file. The scanning result, along with information such as the uploaded file's name, size, type, and more, is then stored in the database. On the frontend, I attempted to automate this process to some extent. After users complete registration and login processes, they can upload files for virus scanning. The information about the uploaded files can be viewed in a table. User information such as passwords is hashed with SHA-256 before being stored in the database. Users with matching email and password in the 'user' table can access the 'files' table.

Spring Boot ve React kullanarak 3 4 haftada yapmış olduğum fullstack uygulamanın frontend bölümüdür. Backend'de bir script dosyası çalıştırılarak powershell'den Windows Defender'a erişim sağlıyorum ve burada istenen dosyayı taratıyorum. Tarama sonucunu, yüklenen dosyanın tarama sonucu, isim, boyut, tür vb. bilgilerini veritabanına kaydediyorum. Frontend'de ise bunu bir nevi otomatize hale getirmeye çalıştım. Kullanıcı kayıt ve giriş işlemlerini yaptıktan sonra virüs taraması için dosya yükleyebilir, yüklenen dosyaların bilgilerini tabloda görüntüleyebilir. Kullanıcının şifre gibi bilgileri SHA-256 ile hashlenerek veritabanına kayıt edilmiştir. 'user'tablosunda mail ve parolası ile eşleşen kullanıcılar 'files' tablosuna erişim sağlayabilir
